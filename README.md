# Mastercard-Assignment

This program was made as part of the Mastercard internship appliation proess. 

The goal of the assignment was to create a HTML webpage from scratch which would 
contain a credit card form.

It also contains JavaScript validation to ensure only numbers can be entered, to 
make sure it is a valid credit card number, expiry date has not passed and that 
the errors will be displayed once the user presses the pay button.

Lastly it should log the input values in the JavaScript console of the browser, 
display a success message and clear the details from the form.
